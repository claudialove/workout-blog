## About Repo 
this repo has to be setup locally and includes js for the schema and a script you can uncomment seed some test data, but even if you dont do that, once your local db has the db schema the app gives you all the functionality you need to make new workouts and then EDIT and DELETE from you fitness blog as you would see fit

There is a an external MONGO DB setup which passes data back and forth on my heroku deploy files - but the app still will not open on the heroku link: which while disappointing is par for the course at this point in learning:
